#Student Monitoring System
This project helps in showing ability of students on the basis of how they performed
in the test provided by us.

_Following are the steps taken into the consideration:_<br />

i. To establish a baseline the student will be taking a self assessment test, which will lay
   the foundation of our suggestion algorithm. From this test we will get to know the
   student's initial field of interests.This could help in analysing his/her personality &
   cognitive skills. <br />
