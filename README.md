# Student Monitoring System<br />
This project helps in showing ability of students on the basis of how they performed
in the test provided by us.

_Following are the steps taken into the consideration:_<br />

i. To establish a baseline the student will be taking a self assessment test, which will lay
   the foundation of our suggestion algorithm. From this test we will get to know the
   student's initial field of interests.This could help in analysing his/her personality &
   cognitive skills. <br />

ii. Based on our first assessment some suggestions will be made, the success of these
suggestions is assessed and further recommendation is based on this. <br />

iii. The self assessment test can be taken multiple times and changes to preferences and
interests can be made any time. <br />

iv. The Skills used in co- curriculars and projects and initiatives are also taken into account
for making suggestions and increasing employability projection of students.<br />
